To run this make sure you have the expo CLI and the Amplify CLI installed.

You'll either need to have a mobile device simulator installed on your computer,
or have an actual mobile device with the Expo application installed.

Use `amplify add storage` and `amplify push` to wire up your instance of the
project to your S3 account.

Then run `expo start`, and enjoy sending voice recordings from your phone to the cloud!
